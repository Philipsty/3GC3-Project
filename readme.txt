3GC3 Project Prototype

The project is a paint ball shooting range, as of now the shooter is stationary
with an arrow-key controlled crosshair which aims where the paintball will be shot from 
(using spacebar to fire).The floor and wall are simple flat polygons, the paintballs are created with the 
Paintball.cpp class and drawn with glutSolidSphere. The paintball splatters on the
wall on wall and paintball collision and displays a square with the Splatter.cpp class. Both 
splatters and paintballs are stored in vectors. Two lights have been enabled in the environment and
material properties have been applied to the paintballs. We made firing more realistic in the way the
crosshairs movement affects the location the paintball lands. Some buttons added include r, g, and b
which will turn all paintballs to either red blue or green. 'w' will set the colours back to random

For the final submission we will implement detailed splatters which will have dynamic
shapes and blend colors (for overal splatters). We will also include a menu to change the paintball colours
